Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique used to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with external, trusted knowledge sources. 
Instead of relying solely on pretrained model weights, RAG systems retrieve relevant documents at query time and feed them into the model as context.

## Key Components of a Production-Grade RAG System

1. **Document Ingestion & Preprocessing**
   - Documents are collected from PDFs, text files, knowledge bases, or websites.
   - Text is cleaned, normalized, and split into smaller logical chunks.
   - Recommended chunk size: 500–700 tokens with an overlap of 100 tokens.

2. **Embeddings Generation**
   - Each chunk is converted into a numerical vector representation using OpenAI embeddings.
   - The recommended embedding model for most applications is `text-embedding-3-large`.
   - Embeddings help capture semantic meaning rather than just keywords.

3. **Vector Storage**
   - The vectors are stored in a vector database like ChromaDB.
   - Chroma stores embeddings effectively and allows fast similarity search.
   - Persistent storage ensures data survives restarts.

4. **Retrieval Mechanism**
   - When a user asks a question, the system converts the query into an embedding.
   - The query embedding is matched against stored vectors using cosine similarity.
   - Top-k (usually k = 5) relevant chunks are retrieved.

5. **Context Assembly**
   - Retrieved chunks are merged into a contextual prompt.
   - Additional metadata, citations, and sources may be added.
   - This ensures the LLM has accurate, grounded information.

6. **LLM Response Generation**
   - The prompt is fed into OpenAI’s `gpt-4o-mini` or `gpt-4.1`.
   - The model uses reasoning + retrieved knowledge to generate an accurate response.

7. **Evaluation**
   - Systems require continuous testing and metrics.
   - RAG evaluation includes:
     - Faithfulness
     - Precision
     - Answer relevance
     - Context recall

8. **Production Considerations**
   - Add caching to reduce API costs.
   - Use observability tools to track retrieval quality.
   - Version your vector database.
   - Ensure your document ingestion pipeline handles real-time updates.

## Example Concepts Stored in This Knowledge Base

- RAG improves model accuracy by up to 40–60% on proprietary datasets.
- Overlapping chunks ensure the model does not miss important contextual links.
- Retrieval pipelines can include reranking for even more precision.
- Structured ingestion allows domain-specific systems such as legal, finance, or healthcare RAG.
- Dual-stage retrieval (similarity search + reranker) performs significantly better than simple cosine similarity alone.

## FAQ Section

**Q: What happens if no relevant documents are found?**  
A: The LLM may hallucinate, which is why fallback filters and confidence scores are recommended.

**Q: Which vector DB is best?**  
A: Chroma is excellent for local use. Pinecone is better for scalable cloud deployments.

**Q: Can RAG handle multiple file formats?**  
A: Yes — PDFs, TXT, CSV, HTML, Word files, and even audio (using transcription) can be ingested.

**Q: What is the ideal architecture for production?**  
A: A modular system with:
   - ingestion service  
   - vector DB  
   - retrieval service  
   - LLM service  
   - API gateway  
   - monitoring and logs
